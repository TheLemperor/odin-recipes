    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This amazing Hawaiian comfort food classic is made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, 
      brown gravy and finished with a fried egg. Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? 
      We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is 
      the perfect solution. Garnish with green onions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 (4 ounce) patties ground beef</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1.5 cups beef stock</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>2 drops sesame oil, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ketchup</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar (optional)</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</li>
      <li>Whisk beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, ketchup, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty in the hot skillet until a browned crust forms on the bottom, about
        5 minutes. Flip; toss in green onions and cook the other side until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patty and most 
        of the green onions to a plate.
      </li>
      <li>Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes.
        Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.
      </li>
      <li>Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side by side until whites are set and yolks are still runny</li>
      <li>Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over the rice, spoon grav on top, and add the fried eggs.</li>
    </ol>
