    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A few weeks ago, I shared my super simple and delivious Chinese-style 10 minute vegetarian fried rice. Now, it's time to switch up the flavours and add in someone
      protein. 10-minute seafood fried rice is on the menu tonight. It's a one-pan, quick and easy, better than takeout meal that can be made at home tastier and with 
      healthier ingredients. It's the easiest weeknight meal.
